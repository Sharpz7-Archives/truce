# Random Forest Classifier for Hand Gesture Recognition

Test data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyr7plus/emg-4?resource=download

> Gesture classes were : rock - 0, scissors - 1, paper - 2, ok - 3. Rock, paper, scissors gestures are like in the game with the same name, and OK sign is index finger touching the thumb and the rest of the fingers spread. Gestures were selected pretty much randomly.
